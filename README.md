# Previewable-Watermark
This is the Matlab code for the paper "Previewable Client-Side Watermarking for Copyrighted Image Sharing"

--Folders named SS and STDM correspond to the first and second scheme, respectively.

--The inputs for “main_SS” and “main_STDM” are grayscale images. The inputs for “main_SS_rgb” and “main_STDM_rgb” are grayscale images. Other script files with names starting with “main” are used for experimental testing. 

--Some correspondences: Proportion_tz --> P_a, Proportion_yc --> P_h, aa --> a, S --> R, BCH_length --> L_B, len_skm --> L_h, md --> P.
